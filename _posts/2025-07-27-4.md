- System configuration for development (compilers, debuggers, shells)
- Package management and environment setup
- Bash scripting and automation
- File systems and permissions
- Developer tools (e.g., `tmux`, `vim`, `git`, etc.)

> 🐧 The goal is to build strong **Linux fluency** for development, debugging, and server-side operations.
