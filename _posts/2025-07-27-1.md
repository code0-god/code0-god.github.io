## ***About Lecture***
This was a short-term special course offered by **Seoul National University (SNU)**.    
The topic was ***"Building a Modern Machine Learning Accelerator"***, and the goals of this short course are as follows:   
1. Why accelerators for modern machine learning?
2. What are we accelerating and how?
3. What do modern accelerators look like, ***<u>and why</u>***?
