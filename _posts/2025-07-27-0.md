```cpp
// PID 1 (init) only
if (getpid() == 1) {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    if (fork() == 0) 
        printf("Let's study!\n");
}
```
Just as the init process forks a new life, today I fork this blog into existence.   
From this moment on, every insight will be logged, every fault examined, and every reflection will guide the next execution.
