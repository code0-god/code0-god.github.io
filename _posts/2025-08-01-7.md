## ***Abstract*** 
This outline presents the high-level research plan for ***accelerating dynamic DNN workloads*** at the runtime and system software levels.

## ***1. Introduction*** 
Dynamic DNNs&mdash;neural networks whose input shapes or structures change at runtime&mdash;pose unique challenges for both hardware and system software.
This research aims to leverage the Gemmini accelerator and the llama.cpp inference engine to develop and evaluate runtime and system-level optimizations for such workloads.

## ***2. Organization***
1. **Gemmini Hardware Analysis** &mdash; Analysis of the Gemmini accelerator’s microarchitecture and its key components.

2. **llama.cpp Framework Analysis** &mdash; Review of the llama.cpp (GGML) inference engine’s architecture and operational flow.

3. **Research Progress Updates** &mdash; Summary of ongoing work: porting, profiling, and optimization experiments.
