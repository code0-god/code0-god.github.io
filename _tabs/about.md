# ***About Code0:***
Welcome to ***Code0:*** , a personal log and reflection space by a computer‑architecture researcher and enthusiast.   
I document my journey in as follows:   
- ***C/C++***
- ***Computer Organization & Architecture (CO&A)***
- ***Operating Systems (OS)*** 
- ***AI acceleration (AI-accel)*** research (as an undergrad intern), 
- ***Coding Challenges***
- ***Data Structures & Algorithms***   

Here, system faults and unexpected traps in both silicon and life become an opportunities to record, reflect, and resume.

## ***Philosophy***
- ***Faults are inevitable***.   
Just as a page fault or pipeline hazard can’t always be prevented, unexpected events in research and life will occur.

- ***We don’t hide or “fix” every glitch***.   
Instead of masking errors, we dump state, examine the logs, and learn from the failure.

- ***Reflection is the key to progress***.   
Each post includes lessons learned, acting as a “reflection daemon” that turns raw logs into insight--so the next execution runs more smoothly.

## ***What You’ll Find Here***
- ***Study Notes***   
***C/C++*** tips, ***CO&A*** topics, ***OS*** internals, ***AI-accel Research***, and more.

- ***Project Logs***   
Undergrad AI‑acceleration research, hardware benchmarks, system‑level experiments, and internship stories.

- ***Coding Challenges***  
Baekjoon problem write‑ups, algorithm optimizations, and competitive programming insights.

- ***Reflections***   
Lessons from failures, performance tuning stories, debugging journeys, and retrospective analyses.
